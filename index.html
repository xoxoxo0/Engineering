<h2>Engineering Journal</h2>
<p>9/2/2022 - We learned about electrical engineering. I also learned how to use Tinkercad and make 3D designs. Learned about safety tools for engineering. </p>


<p>9/16/22 - We made our own paper boat and put some weight on top of it to see if it float. Our group ended with 5min float with 100g. It was hot outside but had a great experience out of this whole week. </p>

<p>9/23/22 - We finally finished our project and tested to see if it actually works. It worked and sucessfully popped our baloon. Took pictures and videos to record what happened.</p>

<p>9/30/22 - We finished dissecting our laptop and experienced on what exaclty is in our laptop. Found some intersting parts of the laptop that I never seen before. Had some time struggling putting it back on, but it was worth it.</p>
