<h2>Engineering Journal</h2>
<p>9/2/2022 - We learned about electrical engineering. I also learned how to use Tinkercad and make 3D designs. Learned about safety tools for engineering. </p>

<p>9/16/22 - We made our own paper boat and put some weight on top of it to see if it float. Our group ended with 5min float with 100g. It was hot outside but had a great experience out of this whole week. </p>

<p>9/23/22 - We finally finished our project and tested to see if it actually works. It worked and sucessfully popped our baloon. Took pictures and videos to record what happened.</p>

<p>9/30/22 - We finished dissecting our laptop and experienced on what exaclty is in our laptop. Found some intersting parts of the laptop that I never seen before. Had some time struggling putting it back on, but it was worth it.</p>

<P>10/4/22 - We started our project in TinkerCAD and worked on our prosthetic stuff. I personally worked on Dog's teeth, it was interesting to actually see the inside of the dog's mouth, because my dog hates me ;-;</P>

<P> 10/13/22 - We worked on CADing our bottle rocket, we finished our general idea of how to make bottle rocket to function with parachute. I also made paper airplane to hit the bucket, but I failed pretty hard.</P>

<p>10/14/22 - We had guest speaker to explain it to us what aerospace engineers do and what they have to focus in order to accomplish what they want. Learned what's in space that are humanmade, it was interesting to listen.</p>

<p> 10/26/22 - We created bottle rocket to experiment the life of aerospace engineers and tested our rocket. Our rocket didn't really work because there was a hole on our rocket so it just was there. Next time we make our bottle rocket, I will make sure that there is no hole on it.</p>
